# Crowdsourced Spatiotemporal Data Collection and Analysis System

This project aims to create a comprehensive system for collecting, managing, and analyzing crowdsourced spatiotemporal data related to human mobility. Users voluntarily share their location history data, contributing to both personal insights and broader city-level analysis to improve urban planning and emergency response.
