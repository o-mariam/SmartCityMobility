Crowdsourced Spatiotemporal Data Collection and Analysis System

This project focuses on developing a system to collect, manage, and analyze crowdsourced spatiotemporal data related to human mobility. Users can voluntarily contribute their location history data, allowing for both personal insights and city-level analysis.

Key Features:
User Contributions: Users share their location history (e.g., from Google Location History) to a common repository.
Personal Insights: Users receive feedback on how environmentally friendly their mobility patterns are (e.g., walking, cycling).
City Planning: Aggregated data helps city planners improve urban infrastructure like sidewalks and bike lanes.
Emergency Response: Identifies population concentration areas to optimize emergency services deployment during disasters.
This system is designed for the city of Patras, with two types of users:

Administrator: Manages population-level data and supports urban planning.
User: Contributes data and receives mobility analysis.
